BBallParser Explanation
========
The BBallParser DSL is designed to quickly put out basketball stats for a given game with a simple,
clearly laid out short hand language.


DSL Syntax Explanation
========
The language works by having each line in the file correspond to something happening in the game. For example
one line could be "3fgm h44 h22;". That would correspond to Home player 44 scored a field goal and was assisted
Home player 22.


Syntax Rules:

Players: Each team is designated by either h (home) or g (guest). To specify what player it is you put there player
number right after the number like this "h22"

-fgm (Field Goal Make): is for when a player scroes a basket. It has one required parameter and two optional ones.
The required parameter is who scored the basket. The two optional ones who assisted the player and who go the rebound

-fga (Field Goal Assist): is for when a player attempts to score a basktet. It has one required parameter and two optional ones.
The required parameter is who attempted the basket. The two optional ones who assisted the player and who go the rebound

-f (Foul): is for when a player gets fouled. It has two required parameters and two optional parameters.
The two required parameters are the player who was fouled and what time he was fouled at. The two optional parameters
are freethrow makes and freethrow attempts. Some example inputs would be:
- f g38 3:33;
- f h33 3:33 m g43;
- f h33 3:33 m g43 m g23;
- f h33 3:33 a g43 h24;
The first example is somebody getting fouled. The second is somebody getting fouled and scoring one basket and the third is some scoring two.
The fourth  is somebody getting foulde and failing score their freethrow.

-Freethrows (m or a): These come after a foul:
- m has only one parameter (thats required). The player who made the basket.
- a has two required parameters. The first is the player who attempted the baskter and the second is caught the rebound.

-t (turnovers): Is for when ball switches teams. This has one required and one optional parameter. The first is who
caused the turnover to happen. The second is who stole the ball. It's optional because the ball can be turned over without
having it be stolen.

-q (quater): This logs when a quater ends. It requires putting a number right after the q to signify what quater it is.
It looks like this:
- q2
- q3
- q4

DSL Discussion
==============
With our language it automatically parses the stats to a readable and nicely formatted table. If a general-purpose language was used then essentially everything we wrote for
our DSL would have to be rewritten to parse our input, organize stats, and then once categorized then be printed and formatted in a readable format.
As for handwriting, you'd have to go through every line to parse through the data, and then find a way to nicely format the stats - which would be very inefficent if done
by hand.
