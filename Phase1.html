**Project Selection | Phase 1**


Domain
========

Our domain is defined as a basketball game.

Problem
========
The problem that we are attempting to solve is taking statistics during a basketball game. We will solve the problem for the main in game events (eg: fouls, 2/3 field goals, assists, rebounds, and turnovers). We want to be able to alert the user when rules in the game occur (such as when a player hits 5 personal fouls). We also want our language to be able to handle specific optional parameters. It should know the difference between input of 2 parameters and 3 parameters.

Purpose
========
The purpose of the language is to be able to take statistics for a basketball game from the command line.

Solutions/Examples
========
`> fga a4 3 h4`

`Field goal attempt for away 4. Assist attempt for away 3. Defensive rebound for home 3.`

`> fga a4 h4`

`Field goal attempt for away 4. Defensive rebound for home 3.`

`> f a4`

`Foul for away 4.`

`ALERT: 5th Foul for away 4.`

Output
========
The command line will accept events and arguments for an in game event. As a result of the event, the output will be the event repeated in longform via the command line output.
